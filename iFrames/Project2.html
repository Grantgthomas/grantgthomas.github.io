    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <h3 class=".iframe-text"> Managing finances can be a daunting task, but with the right tools, it doesn't have to be. That's why I decided to build Budgie, a full-stack budgeting web app designed to help people keep track of their expenses and stay on top of their budgets.
        <br><br>  
        To create Budgie, I chose to use Go as my primary programming language. Go is a fast, efficient, and easy-to-learn language that is well-suited to web development. I also decided to use MongoDB as my database management system. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is flexible and scalable, making it a great choice for web applications.
        <br><br>  
        For the front-end, I used HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The HTML provides the structure of the web pages, while the CSS provides the styling and layout. These two technologies work together to create a visually appealing and functional web app.
        <br><br>  
        One of the key features of Budgie is the ability to add and categorize expenses. This is accomplished by connecting to the MongoDB database, where all of the expenses are stored. Using Go, I created several endpoints that allow the user to add, view, and modify expenses. The database is updated in real-time, so the user always has access to the most up-to-date information.
        <br><br>  
        In addition to adding and categorizing expenses, Budgie also provides a number of other features, including the ability to set budgets for different categories, view spending reports, and track income. These features are designed to help the user get a better understanding of their finances and make informed decisions about their spending.
        <br><br>  
        In conclusion, Budgie is a powerful and easy-to-use budgeting web app that helps users manage their finances with ease. With its combination of Go, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS, Budgie provides a full-stack solution that is both functional and visually appealing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced budgeter, Budgie is the tool you need to stay on top of your finances.</h3>
