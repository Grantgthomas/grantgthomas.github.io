    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <h3 class=".iframe-text">As a software developer, I am always on the lookout for new and interesting projects to work on. One puzzle game that has captured my attention in recent years is 2048. This tile-based puzzle game challenges players to combine matching numbers to create larger numbers and ultimately reach the goal of 2048.
        <br><br>  
        I decided to develop a command-line version of this game in Java, taking advantage of the object-oriented features and functionality provided by the language. By doing so, I aimed to create an immersive and engaging experience for users, all within the confines of a terminal window.
        <br><br>  
        The program I created is a text-based representation of the game 2048, and it utilizes the Java programming language to facilitate user interaction and game mechanics. It employs an algorithmic approach to generate random tiles, track user moves, and determine win conditions.
        <br><br>  
        To create a more engaging experience for users, I implemented various Java classes to encapsulate game objects and interactions. These classes include a Grid class to represent the game board, a Tile class to represent individual tiles, and a GameManager class to oversee the flow of the game.
        <br><br>  
        Furthermore, I leveraged the power of inheritance and polymorphism to create a modular and extensible design, allowing for future modifications and improvements to the program. Additionally, I utilized Java's standard libraries, such as the Scanner class, to facilitate user input and the console interface.
        <br><br>  
        The end result of my efforts is a functional and enjoyable command-line version of the puzzle game 2048, accessible through the Java interpreter. It provides users with a challenging and entertaining experience, while also showcasing my proficiency in Java programming.
        <br><br>  
        In conclusion, the development of a command-line version of the puzzle game 2048 in Java was a rewarding and educational project that allowed me to demonstrate my skills in object-oriented programming and algorithmic design. By leveraging the power of Java's language features and libraries, I was able to create a functional and engaging game experience for users.</h3>
