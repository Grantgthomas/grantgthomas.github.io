    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <h3 class=".iframe-text"> As a resident of an apartment complex, I frequently have guests visiting me who need to park their vehicles in the designated guest parking area. However, I noticed that the process of submitting a guest parking form was time-consuming and manual, as it involved filling out a paper form and physically handing it over to the security desk.
        <br><br>
        To make this process more efficient, I decided to develop a program that would automate the submission of guest parking forms. I chose to use Go, Python, and SQL for this project because they are versatile and well-suited to the task at hand.
        <br><br>
       Information such as the guest's name, vehicle make and model, and the expected duration of the guests' stay is collected. This information is then passed on to the backend, which is built using Go and SQL.
       <br><br>
        The Go component of the program serves as the main application server and interacts with the SQL database to store and retrieve data. It also handles all the necessary validation and error checking to ensure that the submitted forms are complete and accurate.
        <br><br>
        The Python component of the program is used to generate and send automated emails to the security desk and the resident. These emails include the details of the guest and their vehicle, as well as the expected duration of their stay.
        <br><br>
        The SQL component of the program is used to store the information submitted through the web form. This data can be easily queried and analyzed, allowing for better tracking and management of guest parking in the complex.
        <br><br>
        Overall, the program has been a great success and has significantly reduced the time and effort required to submit guest parking forms. It has also improved the accuracy of the information submitted and has made the guest parking process much more convenient for both residents and the security desk.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, developing a program to automate the submission of guest parking forms was a fun and rewarding project that has helped make a tedious task much more manageable. By using Go, Python, and SQL, I was able to create a robust and scalable solution that has been well-received by residents and the security desk alike.</h3>
